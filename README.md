PomoTracker is a simple pomodoro timer that allows you to track your pomodoros and see your progress over time.
This is a demo project for testing my React skills, learn basis of React Testing Library, Vitest and see how works a UI library like Grommet.

- React.js
- Grommet UI
- React Testing Library
- Vitest

The application has been deployed with Heroku and can be found [here](https://pomo-tracker.herokuapp.com/).

## Future Features

Before adding new features, I want to improve some things:
- Use with Chakra UI, Grommet UI is inconsistent, documentation is hard to understand it has some bugs.
- A better way to handle user settings and data with local storage.
- Add more critical tests.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
